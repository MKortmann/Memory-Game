Hi Mentors! I am still wondering if The Memory Game should work in all browsers? Is
 it ok if it works only in Google Chrome? Should it be also responsive? These informations I did not find in the project specifications documents.



1-GitHub   OK
2-Structure: html, css, javascript OK
3-Images OK

Programming:

1) build a grid of cards OK
  1.1) add functionality OK
  1.1.1) The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. OK
  1.1.2) Click Flip OK
  1.1.3) Card Match? Card do not Match?  Ok
  1.1.4) Winning game? Ok
  1.1.5) Reset Ok


1-NICE EFFECT TURNING THE CARD OK
2-Background color when corrects setted OK

4-Implement running time OK
5-Reset button OK
ERROR: user click at same div and it counts as the same OK


TODO: 

1-Javascript Class/Object
2-Organize the code -> Board Game would be an object with properties and functions.
It will be easier to reread the code because the functions would be not separate int the code.
You attached the things together. It makes sense.

3-Implement Star rating TODOOOOOOOO

4-Compatibilität mit firefox
5-Compatibilität mit internet explorer
6-Comopatibilität mit safari

7-Responsive Design!!!
8-Increase cards (tip: function map() to create and increase the array).

The following are just some of the questions that you'll experience along the way:

What's the ideal workflow?
How many files do I need?
Do I modify the HTML first or the CSS?
How many JavaScript functions do I need?
Should my function be this many lines of code?

Hi Mentors! I am still wondering if The Memory Game should work in all browsers? Is
 it ok if it works only in Google Chrome? Should it be also responsive? These informations I did not find in the project specifications documents.

The following are just some of the questions that you'll experience along the way:

What's the ideal workflow?

Do I modify the HTML first or the CSS?
How many JavaScript functions do I need?
Should my function be this many lines of code?
